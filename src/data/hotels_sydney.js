    "description": "A massive health club, a spa, three bars, two restaurants, and sweeping views over the downtown skyline let you live it up in swank style at the Hilton Sydney, one of the city's top-rated hotels among Priceline guests. The high-rise Hilton houses 577 sleek rooms with spectacular city views. Distinctive furnishings such as chaise longues, glass work desks, extra-tall windows with blackout shades, and LCD TVs are found in all rooms. Pillows can be special-ordered to suit guests' tastes, and the spa-like bathroom is a place you'll never want to leave: it comes equipped with fluffy robes, multiple showerheads, designer toiletries and Aquavision TV sets (in some bathrooms). The fitness center offers an 80-foot-long indoor swimming pool, cardio equipment, free weights, a sauna, a steam room and an extra-large hot tub; after a workout, enjoy a soothing body treatment at the on-site spa. Guests can get drinks at the rooftop bar, the Victorian-era bar or the tapas bar. The award-winning brasserie serves up the tastes of France, while the lobby cafe specializes in casual meals and takeout. Valet and self-parking is available for a fee. The Hilton is across the street from the iconic Queen Victoria Building in the heart of Sydney's downtown shopping and entertainment district, known for its trendy boutiques, restaurants and theaters. The nearest metro station is a half-block away, which provides access to attractions further afield such as Bondi Beach and Olympic Park. Darling Harbour and Sydney Aquarium are both a 10-minute walk. The hotel is seven miles from Sydney Airport. Priceline guests give the Hilton Sydney the thumbs up for its \"incredibly helpful\" staff, as well as high-end amenities like \"fabulous\" showers with television sets and \"comfortable\" beds with lots of pillow choices.

    "description": "Priceline guests enjoy unbeatable views from every direction at the non-smoking Four Seasons Hotel Sydney, along with the city's largest outdoor heated pool, a well-equipped fitness center and a soothing spa. The 34-story Four Seasons soars over Sydney from Circular Quay. All 531 non-smoking rooms and suites overlook the city skyline, and some look down on world-famous landmarks like the Sydney Harbour Bridge or the Sydney Opera House. Luxurious touches include silk and mahogany furnishings, plush beds with your choice of pillows, TVs with in-room movies, mini-bars and coffeemakers. Dine in the hotel restaurant, or opt to stay in with room service. Work up a sweat in the extensive fitness center, then reward yourself with a dip in the heated outdoor pool (the city's largest) or a soak in the hot tub. Six treatment rooms, including one reserved for couples, are available in the spa, which has men's and women's saunas and steam rooms. The Four Seasons, in the historic neighborhood of Sydney known as the Rocks, is a stone's throw from the waterfront. One of the city's beauty spots, the Royal Botanical Gardens, is within easy walking distance. Sydney Aquarium, a family favorite, is just over a kilometer away. Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport is 14 kilometers south. The downtown address distinguishes the Four Seasons Hotel Sydney for Priceline guests, who are treated to 360-degree views, outstanding amenities and a sprawling outdoor pool. ",

    "description": "Sweeping skyline views from the rooftop health club, the full-service spa and two gourmet restaurants are just the beginning at the non-smoking Sheraton Grand Sydney Hyde Park. The centerpiece of the Sheraton's expansive lobby is the grand staircase, which sweeps guests upstairs to 557 elegant rooms and suites that combine classic amenities with contemporary decor and furnishings: SweetSleeper beds, blackout shades, writing desks, Wi-Fi, 24-hour room service, DVD players, minibars and coffeemakers. The crowning glory of the hotel is the top-floor health club, which features an indoor saltwater pool under a domed glass roof, adjacent to an outdoor terrace that offers a bird's-eye view of the harbor. The fitness center also includes a wide array of cardio equipment and weight machines, plus personal trainers, a sauna, a hot tub and a steam room. Re-energize body and soul in the day spa, which offers everything from a vanilla bean body polish to a reflexology massage, then gorge at the tapas bar, tea lounge, brasserie or buffet restaurant. The 24-hour cyber cafe lets guests not only connect to the web for free, but also offers board games, international newspapers and boarding pass printouts. Valet parking is available for a fee. The Sheraton offers a location directly opposite the tree-lined Hyde Park, between the central business district and shopping/entertainment district. Just about everything is a 10- to 20-minute walk: Darling Harbour and Sydney Aquarium, the Sydney Opera House, Circular Quay ferry terminal, the Botanic Gardens, the Museum of Contemporary Art, and Sydney's historic Rocks area, with its outdoor markets, pubs and restaurants. The Monorail, metro and bus are all within a block or two, and offer access to points further away such as Bondi Beach, Olympic Park and the Homebush factory outlet stores. Sydney Airport is seven miles away. The Sheraton Grand Sydney Hyde Park is highly rated by Priceline guests, especially since it is \"conveniently located\" in the city center, transportation, shopping and the Opera House. ",
