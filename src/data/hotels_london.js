    "description": "From their base at the centrally located, non-smoking Trafalgar St. James London, guests can enjoy the best of London theater, dining, shopping and sightseeing, as well as a rooftop bar and a seasonal menu in the hotel restaurant. All 129 modern rooms in the five-story, non-smoking Trafalgar have flat-panel TVs, DVD players, stereos, coffeemakers, minibars, high-speed internet access for a fee and aromatherapy toiletries. Sample the menu at the hotel restaurant and enjoy a drink in the rooftop bar, which specializes in whiskeys and fantastic views. A fitness center keeps indulgences in check, and the business center keeps work-related chaos at bay. Ask the concierge for insider tips and theater tickets. Parking is available. Choosing which theater production to see in this neighborhood may be tough; find out what's on at Her Majesty's Theatre or the Theatre Royal Haymarket, both within a five-minute walk. Restaurants are in abundance; it would be hard to walk down the street in any direction and not find something delicious within a quarter-mile. Charing Cross underground station is less than a block away, and Heathrow Airport is 17 miles away. The view from the rooftop bar is hard to beat, but the Trafalgar St. James London also impresses Priceline guests with its \"helpful\" staff and \"great location\" near attractions, theaters, restaurants and shops.
