    "description": "Plush beds and a rooftop bar two blocks south of Times Square are part of what make a satisfying stay for Priceline guests at the non-smoking Four Points by Sheraton Midtown. The 33-floor Four Points boasts views of the Hudson River and nearby Empire State Building from its rooftop bar and some of its 244 rooms. It may be super hectic outside the front door, but indoors you'll sleep like a baby on the nine-inch Serta plush-top sleep system mattress, topped with a down comforter. Watch some premium cable on the LCD flat-panel TV, plug your iPod into the iHome and groove away. The hotel also has a 24-hour fitness center, concierge, bistro with classic Irish dishes and lobby lounge with global beer collection. Parking is available nearby for a fee. The hotel is in the Clinton district of Manhattan, two blocks from the Times Square action and the theaters of Broadway. Port Authority Bus Terminal is just a four-minute walk away and there are plenty of international restaurants surrounding the hotel. LaGuardia Airport is nine miles away, and Newark Liberty International and John F Kennedy International Airports are less than 20 miles from the hotel.  Priceline guests find \"very spacious\" rooms, an \"awesome\" breakfast and a location \"convenient to Times Square and theaters\" when they choose the Four Points By Sheraton Midtown - Times Square.

    "description": "New York City's only revolving rooftop restaurant towers 50 floors above Times Square at the non-smoking New York Marriott Marquis, where plush beds and a super-central glam location are pluses for Priceline guests. The 49-floor Marriott takes up an entire city block, and its 1,949 rooms feature signature beds, spacious marble bathrooms, free Wi-Fi and flat-panel TVs. Get a real adrenalin rush with a workout in the 4,000-square-foot fitness facility overlooking Times Square. Or zoom up the 37-floor atrium in glass elevators for jaw-dropping views. The hotel has five restaurants and several lounges, including a New American eatery and a Broadway-themed lounge overlooking Times Square. Enjoy spectacular city views from the 50th-floor revolving rooftop restaurant. Valet parking is available for an additional fee, and there's also a daily resort charge. NOTE: The hotel will be undergoing renovations to the 8th floor public spaces, including bars and restaurants, from June 20 through October 31, 2020. Alternate food and beverage venues will be available during this time. The Marriott is on Broadway, in the heart of glitzy Times Square. Dozens of Broadway theaters are just outside the hotel (and there's one inside, as well). Central Park is a 15-minute walk away. There is a major subway hub within a few blocks for access throughout the city. LaGuardia Airport is eight miles, John F. Kennedy International Airport is 18 miles and Newark Liberty International Airport is 15 miles from the hotel. With a \"premier location\" right in the middle of show-stopping Times Square action, \"fantastic\" views and \"big rooms,\" the New York Marriott Marquis gets the nod from Priceline guests who have an \"awesome experience.\" ",

Designed by the renowned Morris Lapidus in 1959, the 20-floor Metropolitan has a retro modernist exterior shaped like a perpendicular blue wave. The hotel has a fun history: the famous scene in \"The Seven Year Itch\" where a subway vent blows Marilyn Monroe's skirt up was filmed in front of the hotel. The 759 contemporary rooms have granite countertops, flat-panel HDTVs, Wi-Fi (surcharge) and signature Doubletree beds with custom-designed mattresses, baffle-box, down blankets, and high-thread-count cotton linens with triple sheeting. Property amenities include a restaurant, a lounge, a fitness center and concierge service. Valet parking is available for an additional fee. The Doubletree is at Lexington and 51st Street in Midtown Manhattan. LaGuardia Airport is eight miles, JFK is 16 miles, and Newark Airport is 15 miles from the hotel. All of the Big Apple, and we mean all of it, can be viewed from the Top of the Rock at Rockefeller Center, three blocks west. Radio City Music Hall is four blocks, and the Theatre District is five blocks west. It's a short stroll east to the East River and the United Nations. A subway stop is next to the hotel.  Priceline guests call this a great place to sleep in The City That Never Sleeps, with a \"great view,\" \"clean, spacious rooms,\" \"warm, friendly staff\" and a location near Rock Center and the subway.

The 18-story Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott New York Manhattan/Chelsea has a dashing, high-rise profile, and its common areas are light and airy, such as the glassed-in dining area where guests enjoy the daily continental breakfast. You can also take a seat at the indoor communal table and get to know your fellow travelers. If there's no time for a sit-down meal, the staff will prepare a to-go bag of morning munchies. The fitness room is filled with free weights and cardio equipment. All 108 non-smoking rooms have pillowtop mattresses dressed in crisp linens. The 37-inch flat-panel TVs are a nice touch, as are the Wi-Fi and wired internet connections. If you have last-minute work to finish, the spacious desks make ideal virtual offices. Room service is available. Off-site parking is offered for a fee. The Fairfield Inn is a few blocks south of Bryant Park and the New York Public Library. If you're headed to a Broadway show, Times Square is about 14 blocks north. At least 10 different subway lines converge nearby, so getting around the city is a cinch. LaGuardia Airport is nine miles east, JFK Airport is 17 miles southeast, and Newark Airport is 15 miles southwest. In the heart of the Flower District, the Fairfield Inn and Suites New York Manhattan/Chelsea wins praise from Priceline guests for its \"great location,\" \"so-friendly\" staff and \"solid\" free breakfast.

    "description": "Impeccable Japanese comfort, downy beds, terrific views, marble baths and plasma TVs make The Kitano New York a winner with Priceline guests. The 18-story Kitano offers 149 lavish guestrooms with custom-designed mahogany accents, original Japanese floral art, and cherry furnishings. Down comforters and pillows sit atop pillowtop mattresses. Soundproofed windows open to the sights and sounds of the city, but close for a silent sleep. Rooms also have plasma TVs with HBO channels, plus Wi-Fi service (surcharge) and large desks. Marble bathrooms create a spa-like feeling with towel warmers and premium toiletries. The hotel bar and lounge features talented jazz musicians five nights a week. Hotel guests and local patrons alike appreciate the in-house traditional Japanese restaurant, which includes private tatami rooms. The café in an adjacent townhouse offers Japanese-American choices for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Parking is available for a fee. The Kitano is seven blocks from the Empire State Building and four blocks from Grand Central Terminal. If you're driving to the hotel, LaGuardia Airport is a 20-minute drive, JFK is 30 minutes, and Newark's airport is 30 minutes away (all times dependent on traffic conditions).  When Priceline guests say \"sayonara\" to the Japanese-inspired Kitano New York, they miss its sumptuous rooms, stellar views, fine service, and great location near Grand Central and the Empire State.

    "description": "Forget about taxis, as many of the city's most desirable destinations are walking distance from the non-smoking Fairfield Inn & Suites New York Midtown Manhattan/Penn Station. Perks here include a rooftop bar and lounge, a fitness center and extras like a free continental breakfast and internet access. Built in 2013, the 23-story Fairfield Inn & Suites has an ultramodern glass-and-steel facade that ensures that you're always checking out the view. The 225 rooms and suites are done up in contemporary shades of lime and plum and have lots of light streaming through the wide windows. Look for 37-inch LCD TVs with premium movie channels, beds covered with crisp linens and coffee and tea service. Work desks with ergonomic chairs and safes big enough for laptops emphasize that this hotel means business. Free wired and wireless internet access is another plus. After working out in the fitness room, reward yourself with a trip to the rooftop bar and lounge overlooking the city skyline. Complimentary coffee is available in the lobby for whenever you need a jolt, and a free continental breakfast is served every morning. Same-day dry cleaning and laundry service keep you looking spiffy. Parking is available. If you're catching the big game at Madison Square Garden, you'd be hard-pressed to find a hotel closer than the Fairfield Inn & Suites. Also less than one block away is Penn Station, the city's main train station. If you're in the mood for shopping, Macy's is two blocks away. A 15-minute walk from the front door takes you to the Empire State Building. Depending on traffic, LaGuardia Airport is a 22-minute drive northeast, Newark Liberty International Airport is 24-minute southwest, and Kennedy International Airport is a 31-minute drive southeast. An amazing address puts you close to the sights at the Fairfield Inn & Suites New York Midtown Manhattan/Penn Station, where you'll be treated to free internet access and breakfast buffets. ",

Kick back and click on the flat-panel TV. Update your Facebook status to \"on vacation\" courtesy of free Wi-Fi and wired Internet in the rooms. Wake up to the breakfast buffet for eggs, sausage, bacon, bagels, coffee, juice and more. There's an on-site business center and fitness center, and a nearby garage offers reduced parking rates.  In one of Manhattan's trendiest neighborhoods, this Chelsea hotel is 27 minutes northeast of Newark Liberty International Airport, 28 minutes northwest of JFK International Airport and 23 minutes west of LaGuardia Airport. The 23rd Street subway station is a six-minute walk from the hotel, and Penn Station and Madison Square Garden are just three blocks north. Walk four blocks east to the Empire State Building, where you can visit the observation deck on the 102nd floor for a panoramic view of the city. If you're feeling active, head over to Chelsea Piers (17 minutes by subway) where you can bowl and bat to your heart's content. Priceline guests praise the ultra-cool central Manhattan locale of the Hilton Garden Inn Chelsea. They also appreciate the \"excellent beds.\"  ",

    "description": "Atmospheric rooms with plasma TVs and feather beds, a rooftop lounge with panoramic city views and the Theatre District a block away make for a mythical stay at the non-smoking Dream Midtown. True to its name, the 13-floor hotel features surreal design elements, such as a copper statue of Catherine the Great and Neptune, and a glowing, spherical aquarium. A rooftop lounge named for Ava Gardner features \"retro meets French Riviera\" decor and stellar views of Times Square. The likes of Madonna have been spotted here. The 220 guestrooms are designed to engage all the senses, with allergen-free feather beds faintly lit in neon blue and dressed in 300-thread-count Egyptian cotton linens, plus whisper-soft bathrobes, Wi-fi (incurs a fee), plasma-screen HDTVs, and iPod jacks. The hotel also has a fitness center, concierge services, Italian dining, and chic lobby lounge with Louis XVI-style settees. Parking is available for a fee. The hotel is at 55th Street and Broadway in Midtown. LaGuardia Airport is eight miles away, and JFK and Newark are both 16 miles. The subway is one block away. The Ed Sullivan Theater, home to David Letterman, as well as several Broadway theaters are a short walk from the hotel. The New York show-biz glamour you grew up seeing in the movies is alive and well at Radio City Music Hall, six blocks away. This whimsical hotel is a real place to Dream, with plush beds, unique design flourishes, and a choice location near Broadway.  ",
